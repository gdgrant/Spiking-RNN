--- Training Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks
--- Using e-prop 1 optimization
--- Using an input current trace
--- Using synaptic plasticity

Conventions:
 - All time constants are in milliseconds
 - Time-major indexing
 - (Presynaptic -> Postsynaptic) indexing

Master Dimensionality Template:
[time x batch x presynaptic x postsynaptic]
(alternatively, [t,b,i,j])
